Guys can you please check assignment1_group9.py and play with the code to see if rules are implemented correctly? like winnig conditions and colors, topdown, leftright rules etc?
the code works with a random move generator, and alphabeta not used yet.
for implementation purposes, do u know if we should code everything in one .py file or any rule there is?

### TODO LIST:

- [x] Implement a smart heuristic for the eval function
- [x] Implement alpha-beta pruning and replace the naive minimax
- [ ] Add Interactive Deepening and Transposition Tables, test again
- [x] Implement human interaction -> Function implemented, to be checked
- [ ] Implement ELO ratings for the AI using e.g. trueskill
- [ ] If we have time: see where we can speed up the evaluation, it is very slow for >5 board sizes
- [ ] Write a nice report!
