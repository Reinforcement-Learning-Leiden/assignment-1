Guys can you please check assignment1_group9.py and play with the code to see if rules are implemented correctly? like winnig conditions and colors, topdown, leftright rules etc?
the code works with a random move generator, and alphabeta not used yet.
for implementation purposes, do u know if we should code everything in one .py file or any rule there is?

### TODO LIST:

- [ ] Implement a smart heuristic for the eval function
- [ ] Implement alpha-beta pruning and replace the naive minimax
- [ ] Add Interactive Deepening and Transposition Tables, test again
- [ ] Implement human interaction -> Function implemented, to be checked
